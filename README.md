This is a capsule wardrobe website for generating random outfits from the user's wardrobe. You can track the cost per wear of clothes. Tech stack: React, Axios, Node.js (Express, JWT), Typescript, MongoDB.

To do:

- Restrictions on images

- Route protection on client-side too

- Sort clothes by most/least worn, best/worst cost per wear, newest/oldest

- Custom error page

- More mobile friendly, e.g. the logo is too big now

- Organize folders, e.g. make a Schemas folder
